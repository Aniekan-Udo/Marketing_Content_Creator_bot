This morning in our kitchen, we were prepping trays of roasted vegetables for next week’s meals — bright peppers, carrots, zucchini, and broccoli, all lightly seasoned and oven‑roasted to bring out natural sweetness.
Behind every XYZ product is a nutrition‑minded recipe: we balance portions of whole grains, vegetables, and quality proteins to support a healthier plate.
We carefully test sodium levels, added sugars, and portion sizes so you can trust that our meals fit into a health‑conscious lifestyle without extra math on your side.
